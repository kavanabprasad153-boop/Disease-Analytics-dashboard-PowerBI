# Disease-Analytics-Disease-Severity-Yield-Relationship-in-Tomato
Power BI–based analytical dashboard evaluating early blight disease severity (PDI, AUPDC) and its impact on tomato yield using trend, quadrant, and distribution analysis.
This project presents a data-driven analytical assessment of early blight disease in tomato,
focusing on the relationship between percent disease index (PDI), cumulative disease pressure (AUPDC), and yield performance.

An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to visualize disease progression, yield response,
and variability across tomato accessions using advanced analytical visuals.

Objectives:

Analyze the impact of early blight severity on tomato yield

Identify yield trends under increasing disease pressure

Classify accessions using quadrant-based disease–yield analytics

Visualize distribution patterns of PDI and disease components

Key Analytics & Visuals:

KPI Cards: Mean PDI, Mean Yield, AUPDC

Combo Charts: PDI vs Yield trend

Scatter & Quadrant Analysis: Disease pressure vs yield resilience

Matrix & Slicers: Location-wise disease and yield comparison
